# Streamlit-ML-Dashboard
Streamlit-ML-Dashboard is an interactive app for data analysis, EDA, and machine learning. Upload datasets, clean data, and run models like Random Forest, SVM, and K-Means. Simplifies workflows and delivers insights with an easy-to-use interface.

# Interactive Machine Learning and EDA Application

This Streamlit-based application allows users to:
- Upload datasets for automatic analysis.
- Perform data cleaning (e.g., handling missing values, outliers).
- Explore datasets with visualizations and statistics.
- Run machine learning models and view results.

## Features
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values with mean, median, or mode.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Normalize/standardize data.
   - Detect and handle outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics.
   - Correlation heatmaps.
   - Distribution visualizations.
   - Pair plots and box plots.

3. **Machine Learning**
   - Choose from six algorithms:
     - Random Forest
     - Decision Tree
     - Logistic Regression
     - KNN
     - SVM
     - K-Means Clustering
   - View classification reports, confusion matrices, or clustering results.
